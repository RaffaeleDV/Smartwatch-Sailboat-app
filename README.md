The development and spread of wearable devices represent an opportunity to improve many sectors, including maritime navigation. This thesis aims to leverage these devices, specifically those known as smartwatches, by developing an application for Android Wear OS that provides users with a collection of features to facilitate sailing navigation.
The application allows access to the following functionalities: the display of essential data needed for navigation such as wind speed, maximum wind gust speed, and the boat’s orientation; anchor management and monitoring of the safe distance from the anchor; visualization of the boat on a map and its navigation; route selection and the necessary data for navigating in that direction; recording data from the boat’s sensors needed for creating polar charts; viewing various polar charts related to the boat based on the sail used; transparent management of connections by utilizing the local connection while on board or a remote connection when using the app away from the boat; and a series of application settings necessary for use on different boats.
Offering easy access to information and functions directly on the user’s wrist, the application aims to improve the usability and safety of navigation. The project successfully integrates with an existing backend, ensuring uninterrupted and real-time data synchronization.
The application was successfully developed, implementing all the intended functionalities. Testing was conducted on a range of commercially available smartwatches, and the correct interfacing with the existing backend was verified.
